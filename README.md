## Dev notes




Alex is working on the GRPC stuff.

CLi from GRPC: https://github.com/NathanBaulch/protoc-gen-cobra
- make sure we PR back to him, as it lots of his other stuff looks good too.

We will need validation and this looks like a clean way to do it
https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation/issues/126

We need the fake data and real data
- gen fake data, and then rosie will have a template to make the real data.
